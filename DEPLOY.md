# Deploying EduTrack

EduTrack is a static web application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS. It can be hosted for free on any static site provider.

## Prerequisites

-   A GitHub account (recommended) or direct upload access.
-   Node.js installed (for building locally).

## Option 1: Deploy to Netlify (Recommended)

1.  **Build the Project**:
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a `dist` folder containing your website.

2.  **Drag and Drop**:
    -   Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
    -   Drag your `dist` folder onto the page.
    -   Your site will be live instantly!

## Option 2: Deploy to Vercel

1.  **Install Vercel CLI** (Optional, or use web UI):
    ```bash
    npm i -g vercel
    ```

2.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    vercel
    ```
    -   Follow the prompts (accept defaults).
    -   Your site will be deployed.

## Option 3: GitHub Pages

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3.  Source: `GitHub Actions` (or use a workflow to build and deploy the `dist` folder).

## Important Note on Data

EduTrack uses **Local Storage**. 
-   **Data is stored in the browser:** If you clear your cache or switch devices/browsers, your data will not be there.
-   **No Backup:** There is no cloud database. We recommend periodically checking your data or taking screenshots of your dashboard.

## Option 4: C++ Self-Hosted Server (Teacher Requirement)

If you need to run the application using C++ as the backend server (e.g. for a school project):

1.  **Build the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Run the C++ Server**:
    - Navigate to the `backend` folder.
    - Double click `run_server.bat` (or run it from terminal).
    - Access your site at `http://localhost:8080`.

This server is written in C++ (using Winsock2) and serves the `dist` folder generated by Step 1.
